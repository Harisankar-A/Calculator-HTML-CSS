# HTML Calculator

This repository contains a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a user-friendly interface with basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Function**: Clears the current input or result.
- **Result Display**: Displays the calculated result on the screen.
- **Responsive Layout**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes.

## How It Works

### HTML Structure:
- **Input Fields**: The calculator has a text input field (`input[type="text"]`) to display the result.
- **Buttons**: The calculator buttons are created using `input[type="button"]` with values representing digits (0-9) and operators (`+`, `-`, `x`, `/`, `.`, `c`, `=`).
  
### CSS Styling:
- **Table Layout**: The calculator is structured inside a table for clean and organized alignment.
- **Styling for Buttons**: Buttons are styled with padding, font sizes, and background colors for easy interaction. The "Clear" button (`c`) is highlighted in red, and the result button is styled with grey text.
- **Responsive Design**: The calculator is centered on the screen with a fixed width and height.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure for the calculator interface.
- **CSS**: Styling for the buttons, input fields, and layout.
- **JavaScript** (implied for functionality, not provided in the code above): To handle button clicks, operations, and display the result.

## Limitations

- **No JavaScript**: The current code does not include JavaScript for calculation logic, which needs to be added for functionality.
- **Fixed Layout**: The design could be enhanced for mobile responsiveness or more complex layouts.
